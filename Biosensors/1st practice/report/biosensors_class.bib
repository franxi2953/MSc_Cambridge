  abstract = {Cross talk is an important source of error in interpreting surface electromyography (EMG) signals. Here, we aimed at characterizing cross talk for three groups of synergistic muscles by the identification of individual motor unit action potentials. Moreover, we explored whether spatial filtering (single and double differential) of the EMG signals influences the level of cross talk. Three experiments were conducted. Participants (total 25) performed isometric contractions at 10\% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) with digit muscles and knee extensors and at 30\% MVC with plantar flexors. High-density surface EMG signals were recorded and decomposed into motor unit spike trains. For each muscle, we quantified the cross talk induced to neighboring muscles and the level of contamination by the nearby muscle activity. We also estimated the influence of cross talk on the EMG power spectrum and intermuscular correlation. Most motor units (80\%) generated significant cross-talk signals to neighboring muscle EMG in monopolar recording mode, but this proportion decreased with spatial filtering (50\% and 42\% for single and double differential, respectively). Cross talk induced overestimations of intermuscular correlation and has a small effect on the EMG power spectrum, which indicates that cross talk is not reduced with high-pass temporal filtering. Conversely, spatial filtering reduced the cross-talk magnitude and the overestimations of intermuscular correlation, confirming to be an effective and simple technique to reduce cross talk. This paper presents a new method for the identification and quantification of cross talk at the motor unit level and clarifies the influence of cross talk on EMG interpretation for muscles with different anatomy. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We proposed a new method for the identification and quantification of cross talk at the motor unit level. We show that surface EMG cross talk can lead to physiological misinterpretations of EMG signals such as overestimations in the muscle activity and intermuscular correlation. Cross talk had little influence on the EMG power spectrum, which indicates that conventional temporal filtering cannot minimize cross talk. Spatial filter (single and double differential) effectively reduces but not abolish cross talk.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users. A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996\textendash 1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club ({$>$}100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.},

Since HD EMG electrodes have been developed more conveniently to wear with respect to the previous versions recently, HD EMG signals become an alternative for myoelectric prostheses. The electrode shift, which may occur during repositioning or donning/doffing of the prosthetic socket, is one of the main reasons for degradation in classification accuracy (CA).},

  abstract = {Feature extraction is a significant method to extract the useful information which is hidden in surface electromyography (EMG) signal and to remove the unwanted part and interferences. To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study.},

Effective segmentation of electromyography (EMG) start/end points is an important step in the analysis of EMG signals. This paper presents a SEMG segmentation algorithm based on signal envelope and integral electromyography. Compared with manual segmentation, the coincidence rate is more than 90\%. There is no statistical difference in the characteristic parameters of EMG signals calculated from the start/end points obtained by the segmentation algorithm and the manual segmentation method (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). Based on this segmentation algorithm, quantitative analysis and comparison of the force situation of the iliopsoas, musculus gracilis, soleus and tibialis anterior muscles during the complete gait cycle are performed.

  abstract = {Myoelectric pattern recognition systems for prosthesis control are often studied in controlled laboratory settings, but obstacles remain to be addressed before they are clinically viable. One important obstacle is the difficulty of maintaining system usability with socket misalignment. Misalignment inevitably occurs during prosthesis donning and doffing, producing a shift in electrode contact locations. We investigated how the size of the electrode detection surface and the placement of electrode poles (electrode orientation) affected system robustness with electrode shift. Electrodes oriented parallel to muscle fibers outperformed electrodes oriented perpendicular to muscle fibers in both shift and no-shift conditions (p {$<$}; 0.01). Another finding was the significant difference (p {$<$}; 0.01) in performance for the direction of electrode shift. Shifts perpendicular to the muscle fibers reduced classification accuracy and real-time controllability much more than shifts parallel to the muscle fibers. Increasing the size of the electrode detection surface was found to help reduce classification accuracy sensitivity to electrode shifts in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers but did not improve the real-time controllability of the pattern recognition system. One clinically important result was that a combination of longitudinal and transverse electrodes yielded high controllability with and without electrode shift using only four physical electrode pole locations.}

  abstract = {The purposes of this study were threefold: (1) to compare the isometric torque-related patterns of absolute and normalized electromyographic (EMG) amplitude and mean power frequency (MPF) responses for electrode orientations that were parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fibers; (2) to examine the influence of electrode orientation on mean absolute EMG amplitude and MPF values; and (3) to determine the effects of normalization on mean EMG amplitude and MPF values from parallel and perpendicular electrode orientations. Ten adults (5 men and 5 women mean +/- SD age = 23.8 +/- 2.3 years) volunteered to participate in the investigation. Two sets of bipolar surface EMG electrodes (20 mm center to center) were placed parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fibers over the biceps brachii. The subjects performed a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) test followed by randomly ordered submaximal muscle actions in 10\% increments from 10 to 90\% MVIC. Paired t-tests indicated that absolute EMG amplitude values for the parallel electrode orientation were greater (p {$<$} 0.05) than those for the perpendicular orientation at all isometric torque levels except 10\% MVIC For normalized EMG amplitude values, however, there were no significant mean differences between electrode orientations. There were also no differences between electrode orientations for absolute or normalized EMG MPF values. In 30\% of the cases, different torque-related patterns of responses were observed between the parallel and perpendicular electrode orientations for the absolute and normalized EMG amplitude and MPF values. Therefore, the results of the present study support the need for standardizing electrode orientation to compare the pattern of responses for EMG amplitude and MPF values and normalizing EMG amplitude data to compare the mean values.},
