  abstract = {Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5 (M4) was purified to homogeneity from the skeletal muscle of lizard Agama stellio stellio as a poikilothermic animal, using colchicine-Sepharose chromatography and heat inactivation. The purified enzyme showed a single band after SDS-PAGE, corresponding to a molecular weight of 36 kD. The Km values for pyruvate, NADH, lactate, and NAD+ were 0.020, 0.040, 8.1, and 0.02 mM, respectively. Pyruvate showed maximum activity at about 180 microM, with a decline at higher concentrations. The enzyme was stable at 70 degrees C for 30 min, but was rapidly inactivated at 90 degrees C. The optimum pH for the forward reaction (pyruvate to lactate) was 7.5, and for the reverse reaction (lactate to pyruvate) was 9.2. Oxalate, glutamate, Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ were inhibitory in both forward and reverse reactions.},

The within-batch coefficient of variation for the method is 1.2\% or less for glucose concentrations of 0.94 to 3.98 g/liter. The between-batch coefficient of variation is 5.8\% or less for glucose concentrations of 0.29 to 2.91 g/liter. Concentration and readout are linearly related to at least 4.6 g/liter. Analytical recoveries ranged from 100 to 102\%. Carry-over was negligible.

The abundant literature that can be related to the keyword Biosensor proves without doubt that the field is attractive. It is an interdisciplinary area for which sharp limits cannot be defined easily. The concept of biosensor has evolved; for some authors it is a self-contained analytical device that responds selectively and reversibly to the concentration or activity of chemical species in biological samples. A first chemical or physical signal consecutive to molecular recognition by the bioactive layer is converted by the transducer into a second signal, generally electrical, with a transduction mode that can be electrochemical, thermal, optical, or based on mass variation. The biosensing element must be either intimately connected to or integrated within a physicochemical transducer. Numerous attempts to find a universal transducer that matches any kind of reaction have been reported.},

Key factors that may affect sweat lactate are discussed in detail in the second section of this review. Both acetylcholine and catecholamine hormonal signals can trigger sweating independently of one another; differences in sweat output and lactate concentrations are compared. The primary triggers for sweating, exercise and heat are also compared, with exercise-induced sweating being further examined with respect to the exercise intensity. This review examines the significant variations in sweat lactate between bodily sites as well the relationship to physiological parameters such as gender, age and physical fitness, along with the effect of climate adaptation on sweat lactate concentrations.},

They may also be due to limitations on the environment such as temperature or altitude or to patient factors such as improper coding, incorrect hand washing, altered hematocrit, or naturally occurring interfering substances. Finally, exogenous interfering substances may contribute errors to the system evaluation of blood glucose., In this review, I discuss the measurement of error in blood glucose, the sources of error, and their mechanism and potential solutions to improve accuracy in the hands of the patient. I also discuss the clinical measurement of system accuracy and methods of judging the suitability of clinical trials and finally some methods of overcoming the inaccuracies. I have included comments about additional information or education that could be done today by manufacturers in the appropriate sections.

  abstract = {Background Abnormal hematocrit levels may interfere with glucose readings of patient self-assessment blood glucose (BG) meters. The aim of this laboratory investigation was to assess the potential influence of hematocrit variations on a variety of BG meters applying different measurement technologies. Methods Venous heparinized blood was manipulated to contain three different BG concentrations (50{\textendash}90, 120{\textendash}180, and 280{\textendash}350 mg/dl) and five different hematocrit levels (25\%, 35\%, 45\%, 55\%, and 65\%). After careful oxygenation to normal blood oxygen pressure (65{\textendash}100 mmHg), each sample was measured (eight times) with the following devices: Accu-Chek{\textregistered} Aviva, Nano, and Active, Breeze{\textregistered}2 and Contour{\textregistered}, FreeStyle Freedom Lite{\textregistered}, GlucoDr. auto{\texttrademark}, Glucofix{\textregistered} mio Plus, GlucoLab{\texttrademark}, GlucoMen{\textregistered} LX Plus, Nova Max{\textregistered} Link, Nova Max{\textregistered} Plus, OneTouch{\textregistered} Ultra{\textregistered}2 and Verio{\textregistered},On Call{\textregistered} Plus and Platinum, Optium Xceed{\textregistered}, Precision Xceed{\textregistered}, and TaiDoc Fora TD-4227. A YSI 2300 STAT Plus{\texttrademark} glucose analyzer served as reference method. Stability to hematocrit influence was assumed, with {$<$}10\% mean glucose result bias between the highest and lowest hematocrit levels. Results Six of the investigated meters showed a stable performance in this investigation: Accu-Chek Active (7\%), Glucofix mio Plus (5\%), GlucoMen LX Plus (4\%), NovaMax Plus (4\%), Nova Max Link (7\%), and OneTouch Verio (3\%). All other meters failed this hematocrit interference test, with FreeStyle Freedom Lite (11\%), and On Call Platinum (12\%) being the better devices and On Call Plus (68\%), GlucoLab (51\%), TaiDoc Fora TD-4227 (39\%), and Breeze 2 (38\%) showing the worst performance. Conclusions Hematocrit may affect BG meter performance in daily routine. In case of interference, low hematocrit values ({$<$}35\%) result in too high readings. Our results encourage use of meters that are not affected by hematocrit interference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hematocrit (Hct) is a common interferent in test strips used by diabetes patients to self-monitor blood glucose (BG), resulting in measurement bias. Described is an electrochemical BG monitoring system (OneTouch({\textregistered}) Verio{\texttrademark}) that uses a cofacial sensor design, soluble enzyme chemistry, and multiphasic waveform to effectively correct for patient Hct, delivering an accurate reading for whole BG. METHODS: The test strip comprises thin-film gold and palladium electrodes arranged cofacially and spatially separated with a thin spacer. Soluble glucose-sensing reagents are located on the lower palladium electrode and are hydrated on sample application. Blood glucose is oxidized by flavoprotein glucose dehydrogenase, with electron transfer via (reduced) potassium ferrocyanide mediator at the palladium electrode. Hematocrit levels are estimated by measuring oxidation of mediator diffusion to the upper gold electrode during the first portion of the assay. The Hct-corrected glucose levels are determined by an on-meter algorithm. RESULTS: In performance testing of blood samples at five glucose levels (30-560 mg/dl) and five Hct levels (19-61\%), using 12 test meters and 3 test strip lots, 100\% of results (N = 2700) met International Organization for Standardization accuracy criteria (within {$\pm$} 15 mg/dl and {$\pm$} 20\% of reference results at glucose levels of {$<$}75 and {$\geq$}75 mg/dl, respectively). Furthermore, 99.9\% (2698 of 2700) of results were within {$\pm$}12 mg/dl and {$\pm$} 15\% of reference values at glucose levels {$<$}80 and {$\geq$}80 mg/dl, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The technology used in this system provides accurate BG measurements that are insensitive to Hct levels across the range 20-60\%.},
