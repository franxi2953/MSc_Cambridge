# This reaction rule has the same reaction rate for all reactions.  This may be
# correct, depending on the model.  However, it is probably more accurate for the
# the monomer association reaction to be twice as fast, because its association can
# happen in either of two ways.  This change, in polymer_end2.txt, makes the model
# consistent with tbe BioNetGen model of essentially the same name.
