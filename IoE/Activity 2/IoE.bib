  abstract = {Biochips, or digital labs-on-chip, are developed with the purpose of being used by laboratory technicians or biologists in laboratories or clinics. In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OpenDrop, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OpenDrop consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OpenDrop, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47\% of attempts to replicate OpenDrop were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care.},

  abstract = {Cell-free gene expression systems present an alternative approach to synthetic biology, where biological gene expression is harnessed inside non-living, in vitro biochemical reactions. Taking advantage of a plethora of recent experimental innovations, they easily overcome certain challenges for computer-aided biological design. For instance, their open nature renders all their components directly accessible, greatly facilitating model construction and validation. At the same time, these systems present their own unique difficulties, such as limited reaction lifetimes and lack of homeostasis. In this Perspective, I propose that cell-free systems are an ideal proving ground to test rational biodesign strategies, as demonstrated by a small but growing number of examples of model-guided, forward engineered cell-free biosystems. It is likely that advances gained from this approach will contribute to our efforts to more reliably and systematically engineer both cell-free as well as living cellular systems for useful applications.},

  abstract = {The development of large-scale integration (LSI) based on soft lithography has ushered a new revolution in microfluidics. This technology, however, relies inherently on pneumatic control of micromechanical valves that require air pressure to operate, while digital microfluidics uses a purely electrical signal on an electrode for droplet manipulation. In this article, we discuss the prospect and current challenges of digital microfluidics to solve the problem of the tyranny of numbers in arbitrary fluidic manipulation. We distill the fundamental physics governing electrowetting and their implications for specifications of the control electronics. We survey existing control electronics in digital microfluidics and detail the improvements needed to realize a low-power, programmable digital microfluidic system. Such an instrument would attract wide interest in both professional and non-professional (hobbyist) communities.},
