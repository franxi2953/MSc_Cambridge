	abstract = {The suitability of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics for true lab-on-a-chip applications is discussed. The wide diversity in biomedical applications can be parsed into manageable components and assembled into architecture that requires the advantages of being programmable, reconfigurable, and reusable. This capability opens the possibility of handling all of the protocols that a given laboratory application or a class of applications would require. And, it provides a path toward realizing the true lab-on-a-chip. However, this capability can only be realized with a complete set of elemental fluidic components that support all of the required fluidic operations. Architectural choices are described along with the realization of various biomedical fluidic functions implemented in on-chip electrowetting operations. The current status of this EWD toolkit is discussed. However, the question remains: which applications can be performed on a digital microfluidic platform? And, are there other advantages offered by electrowetting technology, such as the programming of different fluidic functions on a common platform (reconfigurability)? To understand the opportunities and limitations of EWD microfluidics, this paper looks at the development of lab-on-chip applications in a hierarchical approach. Diverse applications in biotechnology, for example, will serve as the basis for the requirements for electrowetting devices. These applications drive a set of biomedical fluidic functions required to perform an application, such as cell lysing, molecular separation, or analysis. In turn, each fluidic function encompasses a set of elemental operations, such as transport, mixing, or dispensing. These elemental operations are performed on an elemental set of components, such as electrode arrays, separation columns, or reservoirs. Examples of the incorporation of these principles in complex biomedical applications are described.},

	abstract = {Digital microfluidics (DMFs) show great potential in the fields of lab-on-a-chip applications for electro-chemical as well as biochemical sensing for decades. Various types of DMF devices have been demonstrated to improve their capabilities such as smaller device size for portability, higher reliability, and multi-purpose applications, etc. Among them, the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to manipulate droplets due to its good flexibility. On the other hand, the high-voltage application that required for EWOD-type DMF also limits the portability and dimension of the whole system. In this review, we discuss the DMFs which are powered by alternative sources other than electrical sources and evaluate their potential for future portable biochemical assays. Then, the demonstrations reported with the possibility beyond high voltage are discussed starting from lowering voltage requirement for EWODs to the unique methods using mechanical, optical, and energy harvesting to power DMF devices. Finally, the practical applications and prospective on the integrated multi-functional lab-on-a-chip applications are tackled.},

	abstract = {Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was irradiated in aqueous solution under long wavelengths (λ{\textgreater}300nm, 20°C) and in presence of oxygen. The photooxidation of PEO was studied by IR spectrophotometry, viscometry and size exclusion chromatography. The formation of the oxidation photoproducts was studied by infrared analysis of films obtained by evaporation of aliquots of irradiated aqueous solutions. The photoproducts were identified by chemical derivatization treatments coupled with infrared measurements. Viscosimetry and SEC analysis showed that photooxidation was leading to a dramatic decrease of the molecular weights. The influence of the pH of the aqueous solutions was also examined. Unexpected results were obtained for the pH 12 solutions, indicating a strong inhibition of the oxidation. Comparison with the results obtained in the case of PEO irradiated in the solid state showed that no direct transposition of the knowledge concerning the behavior of the solid polymer could be made.},
