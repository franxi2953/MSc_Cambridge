  abstract = {Biochips, or digital labs-on-chip, are developed with the purpose of being used by laboratory technicians or biologists in laboratories or clinics. In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OpenDrop, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OpenDrop consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OpenDrop, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47\% of attempts to replicate OpenDrop were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care.},

  abstract = {The suitability of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics for true lab-on-a-chip applications is discussed. The wide diversity in biomedical applications can be parsed into manageable components and assembled into architecture that requires the advantages of being programmable, reconfigurable, and reusable. This capability opens the possibility of handling all of the protocols that a given laboratory application or a class of applications would require. And, it provides a path toward realizing the true lab-on-a-chip. However, this capability can only be realized with a complete set of elemental fluidic components that support all of the required fluidic operations. Architectural choices are described along with the realization of various biomedical fluidic functions implemented in on-chip electrowetting operations. The current status of this EWD toolkit is discussed. However, the question remains: which applications can be performed on a digital microfluidic platform? And, are there other advantages offered by electrowetting technology, such as the programming of different fluidic functions on a common platform (reconfigurability)? To understand the opportunities and limitations of EWD microfluidics, this paper looks at the development of lab-on-chip applications in a hierarchical approach. Diverse applications in biotechnology, for example, will serve as the basis for the requirements for electrowetting devices. These applications drive a set of biomedical fluidic functions required to perform an application, such as cell lysing, molecular separation, or analysis. In turn, each fluidic function encompasses a set of elemental operations, such as transport, mixing, or dispensing. These elemental operations are performed on an elemental set of components, such as electrode arrays, separation columns, or reservoirs. Examples of the incorporation of these principles in complex biomedical applications are described.},

First, we performed on- and off-chip comparison experiments for the magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction module and LAMP amplification function. The extraction efficiency for the on-chip test was comparable to that of conventional off-chip methods. The processing time for the automatic on-chip workflow was only 23 min, which was less than that of the conventional methods of 28 min 45 s. Meanwhile, the number of samples used in on-chip experiments was significantly smaller than that used in off-chip experiments; only 5 {\textmu}L of E. coli samples was required for nucleic acid extraction, and 1 {\textmu}L of the nucleic acid template was needed for the amplification reaction. In addition, we selected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid reference materials for the nucleic acid detection experiment, demonstrating a limit of detection of 10 copies/{\textmu}L. The proposed ``all-in-one'' DMF system provides an on-site ``sample to answer'' time of approximately 60 min, which can be a powerful tool for point-of-care molecular diagnostics.},

As an eloquent microscale liquid handling technology that gave birth to digital microfluidics, EWOD has served as the basis for many commercial products over two major application areas: optical, such as liquid lenses and reflective displays, and biomedical, such as DNA library preparation and molecular diagnostics. A number of research or start-up companies (e.g., Phillips Research, Varioptic, Liquavista, and Advanced Liquid Logic) led the early commercialization efforts and eventually attracted major companies from various industry sectors (e.g., Corning, Amazon, and Illumina). Although not all of the pioneering products became an instant success, the persistent growth of liquid lenses and the recent FDA approvals of biomedical analyzers proved that EWOD is a powerful tool that deserves a wider recognition and more aggressive exploration. This review presents the history around major EWOD products that hit the market to show their winding paths to commercialization and summarizes the current state of product development to peek into the future. In providing the readers with a big picture of commercializing EWOD and digital microfluidics technology, our goal is to inspire further research exploration and new entrepreneurial adventures.},

Various types of DMF devices have been demonstrated to improve their capabilities such as smaller device size for portability, higher reliability, and multi-purpose applications, etc. Among them, the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to manipulate droplets due to its good flexibility. On the other hand, the high-voltage application that required for EWOD-type DMF also limits the portability and dimension of the whole system. In this review, we discuss the DMFs which are powered by alternative sources other than electrical sources and evaluate their potential for future portable biochemical assays. Then, the demonstrations reported with the possibility beyond high voltage are discussed starting from lowering voltage requirement for EWODs to the unique methods using mechanical, optical, and energy harvesting to power DMF devices. Finally, the practical applications and prospective on the integrated multi-functional lab-on-a-chip applications are tackled.},

The formation of the oxidation photoproducts was studied by infrared analysis of films obtained by evaporation of aliquots of irradiated aqueous solutions.

Viscosimetry and SEC analysis showed that photooxidation was leading to a dramatic decrease of the molecular weights. The influence of the pH of the aqueous solutions was also examined. Unexpected results were obtained for the pH 12 solutions, indicating a strong inhibition of the oxidation. Comparison with the results obtained in the case of PEO irradiated in the solid state showed that no direct transposition of the knowledge concerning the behavior of the solid polymer could be made.},

However, due to the limitation of electrodes number, the throughput is hard to further upgrade. Therefore, active matrix electrowetting-on-dielectric (AM-EWOD) technology is a solution to acquire larger scale of driving electrodes. However, the process of manufacturing of AM-EWOD based on thin-film-transistor (TFT) is complex and expensive. Besides, the driving voltage of DMF chip is usually much higher than that of common display products.In this paper, a solution for mass production of AM-EWOD based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) is provided. Samples of 32 {\texttimes} 32 matrix AM-EWOD chips was designed and manufactured. A boost circuit was integrated into the pixel, which can raise the pixel voltage up by about 50\%. Customized designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was used to supply the timing signals and driving voltage to make the motion of droplets programmable. The process of moving, mixing and generation of droplets was demonstrated.The minimum voltage in need was about 20 V and a velocity of up to 96 mm/s was achieved. Such an DMF device with large-scale matrix and low driving voltage will be very suitable for POCT applications.},

There are several processes for this: blasting, plasma, pyrolysis, chemical processes, laser, high pressure water, and combinations of these. This work focuses on the characterization of the main factors that condition the FEP coating removal process by a continuous wave (CW) Nd:YAG laser, and on the determination of the efficiency of this type of technology used for this purpose. Stripping surface per unit of time and energy consumption per unit area has been determined among other efficiency indicators. Regarding the characterization of the coating object of study, its thickness, surface roughness, contact angle, microhardness and absorbance-reflectance responses have been determined, and the results have been compared with those obtained in the case of PTFE. In addition, to evaluate the mechanical damage caused in the substrate after coating removal by (CW) Nd:YAG laser, the tensile strength, Vickers hardness, Ra and Rz roughness, and the substrate thickness have been measured and analyzed.},

  abstract = {Polymer-containing solutions used across research and industry are commonly exposed to mechanically harsh fluid processes, for example shear and extensional forces during flow through porous media or rapid microdispensing of biopharmaceutical molecules. These forces are strong enough to break the covalent bonds in the polymer backbone. As this scission phenomenon can change the functional and fluid-flow properties as well as introduce reactive radicals into the solution, it must be understood and controlled. Experiments and models to date have only provided partial or qualitative insights into this behaviour. Here we build a link between the molecular-scale degradation models and the macroscale laminar flow of dilute solutions in any given geometry. A free-draining bead{\textendash}rod model is used to investigate rupture events at the molecular scale. It is shown by uniaxial extension simulations of an ensemble of chains that scission can be conveniently described at the macroscopic scale as a first-order reaction whose rate is a function of the conformation tensor of the macromolecules and the velocity gradient of the flow. This approach is implemented in the finite volume code OpenFOAM by elaborating an appropriate constitutive equation for the conformation tensor. The macroscopic model is run and analysed for ultra-dilute solutions of poly(methyl methacrylate) in ethyl acetate and polyethylene oxide in water, using the geometry of an abrupt contraction flow and neglecting any viscoelastic effect. This multiscale approach bridges the gap between phenomenological observations of mechanically induced chemical degradation in large-scale applications and the rich field of molecular-scale models of macromolecules under flow.},

Such assays may also be used to determine the infection phase based on isotype prevalence. However, ELISAs demonstrate limited sensitivity and are difficult to perform at the point of care. Here, we present a novel technique for label-free, rapid detection of ultra-low concentrations of virus specific antibodies. We have developed a simple, robust capacitive biosensor using microwires coated with Zika or Chikungunya virus envelope antigen. With little discernable nonspecific binding, the sensor can detect as few as 10 antibody molecules in a small volume (10 molecules/30{$\mu$}L) within minutes. It can also be used to rapidly, specifically, and accurately determine the isotype of antigen-specific antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate that anti-Zika virus antibody can be sensitively and specifically detected in dilute mouse serum and can be isotyped using the sensor. Overall, our findings suggest that our microwire sensor platform has the potential to be used as a reliable, sensitive, and inexpensive diagnostic tool to detect immune responses at the point of care.},

Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed, and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented.

The static friction coefficient was found to be {\textasciitilde}\$\$\{10\}\^\{-3\}\$\$Pa{$\cdot$}s, which is on the same order of magnitude as the dynamic viscosity of water, and increases with the droplet size. A nondimensional number defined by the ratio of the standard deviation of wetting velocity to the characteristic wetting velocity was put forward to signify the strength of the inherent contact line fluctuation and unveil the mechanism of enhanced energy dissipation in nanoscale, whereas such effect would become insignificant in macroscale. Moreover, regarding a liquid droplet on hydrophobic or superhydrophobic surfaces, an approximate solution to the base radius development was derived by an asymptotic expansion approach.},
