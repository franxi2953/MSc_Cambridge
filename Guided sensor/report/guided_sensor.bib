  abstract = {Without hardware, there is no science. Instruments, reagents, computers, and other equipment are essential for producing systematic knowledge. Yet, current supply chains limit access and impede creativity and customization through high mark-ups and proprietary designs, compounded by proprietary hardware licenses and patents. Open Science Hardware (OSH) addresses part of this problem by sharing designs, instructions for building, and protocols. Expanding the reach of OSH within academic research, NGO initiatives, citizen science, and education has potential to increase access to experimental tools and facilitate their customization and reuse. We organized with others the ``Gathering for Open Science Hardware'' (GOSH) in 2016 to address what we see as the primary barrier to OSH: early adopters are disparate and separated by geographical and disciplinary borders which limit interaction, exchange and community building. This inaugural gathering brought together 50 of the most active developers, users, and thinkers in the OSH movement, complemented by expertise from diverse backgrounds, to seed a global community. This article provides a review of the activities and debates we conducted at GOSH 2016.},

  abstract = {Wearable health sensors could monitor the wearer's health and surrounding environment in real-time. With the development of sensor and operating system hardware technology, the functions of wearable devices have been gradually enriched with more diversified forms and more accurate physiological indicators. These sensors are moving towards high precision, continuity, and comfort, making great contributions to improving personalized health care. At the same time, in the context of the rapid development of the Internet of Things, the ubiquitous regulatory capabilities have been released. Some sensor chips are equipped with data readout and signal conditioning circuits, and a wireless communication module for transmitting data to computer equipment. At the same time, for data analysis of wearable health sensors, most companies use artificial neural networks (ANN). In addition, artificial neural networks could help users effectively get relevant health feedback. Through the physiological response of the human body, various sensors worn could effectively transmit data to the control unit, which analyzes the data and provides feedback of the health value to the user through the computer. This is the working principle of wearable sensors for health. This article focuses on wearable biosensors used for healthcare monitoring in different situations, as well as the development, technology, business, ethics, and future of wearable sensors for health monitoring.},

  abstract = {Food allergies are estimated to affect about 2{\textendash}5\% of adults and 6{\textendash}8\% of children, globally. Currently, the most effective strategy for food allergy management is stringent avoidance of the offending allergen. Unlike other major food allergens, soy is uniquely challenging to avoid due to its prevalence and insidiousness in a wide variety of foods, such as infant formulas. Recently, we demonstrated a simple, accurate, and consumer-friendly sensor using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for rapid detection of soy allergenic tracers in complex food matrices at clinically relevant levels. In this work, we build on these findings by subjecting MIP-based soy allergen sensors to test trials in 42 different food products, representing over 300 ingredients. Foods were selected based on their compositional complexity to capture a wide range of preparatory methods and processing conditions. In each case, the Allergy Amulet correctly reported on the presence or absence of soy allergen tracer in investigated samples and were subjected to immunoassay confirmatory analysis. The outcome of this research will help resolve persistent difficulties with commercial technologies in detecting allergenic tracers with minimal cross-interference in foods, and will give those with soy allergies the ability to easily, rapidly, and accurately identify and avoid foods with soy allergens.},
